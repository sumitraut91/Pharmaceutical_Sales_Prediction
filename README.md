# Pharmaceutical_Sales_Prediction
In this project, I will analyze the Rossmann Pharmaceuticals dataset containing helpful information about their products' sales & amps; customer behavior. I have created the forecast sales in all their stores across several cities six weeks ahead of time on the basis of factors such as promotions, competition, school, and state.

Tasks done....
 1. Loading and preprocessing data
  
 2. Performing data analysis...
  
 3. Visualizing insights...
  
 4. Monthly Sales for Each Store Type...
  
 5. Distribution of Promo in Train and Test
  
 6. Average Sales on School Holidays vs Non-School Holidays
  
 7. Sales comparison of State Holidays and Non-State Holidays
  
 8. Average Sales Comparison for Different Holidays
    
 9. Comparison of Sales and Customers on Days of the Week
  
10. Sales behavior for the Christmas season 2013-2014
 
11. Sales behavior for the Christmas season 2014-2015
 
12. Correlation between sales and the number of customers
 
13. Effect of Promotion on Existing Customers and Sales
 
14. Calculate the percentage increase in sales for each month
 
15. Calculate average sales for promotion and non-promotion periods
